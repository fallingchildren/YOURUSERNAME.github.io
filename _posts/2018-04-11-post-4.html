<p> One challenge I encountered was trying to make the game map links work on all the html pages. 
I overcame it by changing different settings in the application that I used to create the map. </p>

<p> One element in my game that I'm proud of is adding the images, because I had some difficulty linking them on the pages. </p>

<p> One idea for how I can extend my game in the future could be adding more rooms, and randomizing the pages to make the game harder. </p>
