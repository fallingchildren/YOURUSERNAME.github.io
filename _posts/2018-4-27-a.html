title: First thoughts on final project

<p> I already have an idea that I am excited about. My idea is laser printing jewellry for myself. </p>

<p> I will have to learn how to use the laser printer. The supports that I will need for this game are to teach me how to use the laser printer and to write the code for the printer. </p>

<p> My first steps are finding out what type of jewellry I want to print, and then writing the code for it. </p>
